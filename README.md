# SpaceX Fan

## Work Plan for SpaceX Fan Project

I looked over designs in Zeplin. I have created the simple plan below to follow:

1. Since some details at designs like custom tab bar, blur backgrounds, etc. are a little complex and may have some difficulties to implement, I will skip those parts for now and start with individual tab bar view controllers and basic UI designs. 
2. After I complete tab page designs, I will continue creating business logic. This part will include networking, data models, managers, persistent data storage and so on. I may use some cocoa pods here like Alamofire, Realm, etc.
3. I will add fingerprint authentication to reach favorites.
4. I will make tab bar integration after I see that all tab pages are individually running well.
5. As a design pattern, I will use MVVM and singleton. 
6. I will add Firebase Crashlytics and some app events to track.
7. If I have enough time, I can work on a bonus cloud service.
